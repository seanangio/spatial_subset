The principal purpose of this shiny app is to demonstrate spatial subsetting in R through the [**sf**](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package. It accompanies a series of lessons on GIS in R, including manipulation and mapping, found on the [Social Cops blog](https://socialcops.com/courses/introduction-to-gis-r/lesson5-spatial-subsetting/). Steps for preparation of the data in this app using the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) packages are detailed there.

The median household income data comes from the 2012-2016 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) and was downloaded via the [**tidycensus**](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) package. The census tract shapefiles were downloaded with the support of the [**tigris**](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) package.

The code for this app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/seanangio/spatial_subset).
